# Logistic Regression Model for Predicting Employee Absenteeism

This repository contains a machine learning pipeline for building, evaluating, and deploying a **logistic regression model** that predicts whether an employee is likely to be **excessively absent from work** (defined as more than 3 hours in a single instance).

---

## Project Objective

The goal is to create a data-driven model to:

* **Identify high-risk employees** based on various personal, work-related, and behavioral factors.
* **Predict future absenteeism** likelihood.
* **Provide insights** into what features most strongly influence absenteeism behavior.

## Key Features & Workflow

### 1. **Data Preparation**

* Preprocessed data was loaded (assumed cleaned in a prior notebook).
* Created a binary target variable `excessive_absenteeism` for classification.
* Applied a **custom scaler** to scale only the relevant numeric variables.
* Split into training and test sets (80/20).

### 2. **Model Building & Interpretation**

* Trained a **logistic regression** model using `Scikit-learn` and interpreted with `Statsmodels`.
* Evaluated coefficients and **odds ratios** to identify the most influential features.
* Applied **backward elimination** to simplify the model and remove statistically insignificant predictors.

### 3. **Model Evaluation**

* **Training Accuracy**: \~77.86%
* **Test Accuracy**: \~75.00%
* Indicates strong generalization and **no overfitting**.
* Performance assessed using a **confusion matrix**.

### 4. **Model Serialization**

* Saved the trained model (`model.pkl`) and custom scaler (`scaler.pkl`) using `pickle`.

### 5. **Model Integration**

* Developed a reusable Python class `absenteeism_model` to:

  * Load and preprocess new datasets.
  * Generate **probabilities** and **binary predictions** for excessive absenteeism.
  * Output results in a ready-to-use DataFrame for further analysis or visualization (e.g., in Tableau).

## Output Columns Explained

After running the integration module, you receive a prediction DataFrame with two important columns:

* **`probability`**: The model’s predicted **likelihood** (0–1) that an employee will be excessively absent.
* **`prediction`**: A binary label:

  * `1` = predicted absenteeism is **likely** (probability ≥ 0.5)
  * `0` = predicted absenteeism is **not likely**

## How to Use

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/shree131/absenteeism_prediction_model.git
cd absenteeism-prediction-model
```

2. Install dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

3. Run the integration notebook or import the module in a Python script:

```python
from Absenteeism_Module import *

model = absenteeism_model('model', 'scaler')
model.load_and_clean_data('absenteeism_new_data.csv')
predicted_results  = model.predicted_outputs()
predicted_results.to_csv('absenteeism_predictions.csv', index=False)
print(predicted_results)
```

## Next Steps

* Integrate with business dashboards (e.g., **Tableau**) for live monitoring.
* Improve model performance using advanced classifiers, feature engineering, or additional data.
* Analyze misclassifications and refine the feature set further.
